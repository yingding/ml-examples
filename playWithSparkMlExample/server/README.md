import modules -> from external source code -> sbt -> choose server folder -> after that the server and the server-build will be added.

## 1.1 Testing the Play framework version
* type `sbtVersion` in the play console to show the sbt version
* type `version` in the play console to show your application version
* type `` in the play console to show the  


# 2. Setting up connections to mongodb
The following packages are used to establish a connection to mongodb in play framework. The libraryDependencies are declared in build.sbt file
```
libraryDependencies += "org.mongodb" % "mongo-java-driver" % "3.2.2"
libraryDependencies += "org.jongo" % "jongo" % "1.3.0"
libraryDependencies += "uk.co.panaxiom" %% "play-jongo" % "2.0.0-jongo1.3"
libraryDependencies += "commons-collections" % "commons-collections" % "3.2.1"
``` 

# 3. Install mongodb
* Install the mongodb according to https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
* on the ubuntu server, change the bindIp in /etc/mongd.conf file to your server ip, allow remote access to mongdb server
* restart mongodb with `sudo service mongod restart`
* use `netstat -tulpn` to display the services running in the system


# 4. Adding an admin user to your mongodb server
* `mongo -host <ip of the server>`
* `use mydb` (to create a db names mydb)
* Run the following command in your mongo shell in your server to create a user and password for the database
```
db.createUser({user:"xxxxxxx", pwd:"xxxxxxx", roles:["readWrite", "dbAdmin"]})
```
Note: you shall change the user name and pwd according to your need.

# 5. Open firewall settings on the server to allow remote access to mongodb
* List all the open ports with `iptables -L`
* Use iptable to setup firewall and open the incomming mongdb connections `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 27017 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT`
* save the iptable settings with `sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables.conf`
* (optional) load the iptable settings with `sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.conf`
